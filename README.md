Machine Learning Model Training and Monitoring in AWS using Terraform and MLflow
Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model training pipeline hosted in an AWS environment. The entire infrastructure is provisioned using Terraform. Model training is conducted using a sample CSV dataset, and MLflow is used for experiment tracking and model monitoring.

Project Architecture
Components:
AWS Infrastructure:

EC2 instances for model training.
S3 for data, artifact, and model storage.
IAM roles for access management.
VPC and Security Groups for networking.
CloudWatch for logging and monitoring infrastructure.
Machine Learning:

Python environment for model training.
Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn.
Dataset: Sample CSV file.
Model type: (Specify the model, e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
MLflow:

Used for logging model parameters, metrics, and artifacts.
Enables comparison of multiple models and tracking of experiments.
Terraform:

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for provisioning AWS resources.
All configurations stored in the GitHub Repository.
Prerequisites
AWS account with permissions to create EC2, S3, VPC, IAM roles, etc.
Installed: Terraform, Python, ML libraries, Git.
MLflow tracking server (local or remote).
Setup and Configuration
Terraform Setup:
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/praveensamca/terraform
cd terraform
Initialize Terraform:

bash
Copy code
terraform init
Review Execution Plan:

bash
Copy code
terraform plan
Apply the Terraform Plan:

bash
Copy code
terraform apply
AWS Setup:
EC2 instances for model training.
S3 buckets for storing datasets, model artifacts, and logs.
MLflow Setup:
Start MLflow server (local):

bash
Copy code
mlflow server --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db --default-artifact-root ./artifacts
Access MLflow UI at http://localhost:5000 or use the remote tracking URI.

Model Training Pipeline
Steps:
Data Preprocessing:

Load the sample CSV data using Pandas.
Perform data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering as required.
Model Training:

Select a machine learning algorithm.
Train the model on the dataset.
Log the parameters, metrics, and model using MLflow.
Example code:

python
Copy code
import mlflow
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('path_to_csv.csv')

# Preprocess and split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data.drop('target', axis=1), data['target'], test_size=0.2)

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Log model with MLflow
with mlflow.start_run():
    mlflow.log_param("model_type", "RandomForest")
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")
    mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", model.score(X_test, y_test))
Model Monitoring:

Monitor the training run in MLflow and compare it with previous runs.
Store logs and artifacts in S3.
Outputs and Results
Trained models, performance metrics (accuracy, F1 score), and logs.
MLflow captures:
Training parameters.
Model metrics (e.g., accuracy, loss).
Model artifacts (saved models, plots).
Experiment comparisons for different models.
Monitoring and Maintenance
Use CloudWatch to monitor AWS infrastructure.
Use MLflow UI to compare models, track performance over time, and monitor deployed models.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to set up a scalable machine learning training pipeline on AWS, with monitoring using MLflow. Terraform simplifies infrastructure setup, and AWS services provide scalability and storage.
